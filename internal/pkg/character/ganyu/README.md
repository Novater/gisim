# Ganyu

## Todo

- normal attack
- aimed mode no charge
- aimed mode charge lvl 1
- plunge attack
- A4 field effect (doesn't seem to affect Ganyu herself?)
- Q aura ICD

## Assumptions

- every charge attack lvl 2 applies cryo twice (arrow + bloom)
- Q only hits target once every so often (single target)
