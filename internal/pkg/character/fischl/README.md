# Fischl

## Todo

- a2 (are we ever going to sim aiming at bird?)
- normal attack
- aimed mode no charge
- aimed mode charge
- plunge attack
- c2 aoe (single target mode only right now)
- c4 (characters dont take dmg atm)

## Assumptions

- every charge attack lvl 2 applies cryo twice (arrow + bloom)
- Q only hits target once every so often (single target)
- Fischl A4 is assumed to not apply electro
- only initial application of EC will trigger Fischl A4 (need to test this, does ticks trigger A4?)
- ReactedTo field is not implemented; Fischl A4 on swirl will not work

## Issues/Bugs

- Oz ICD not implemented correctly yet (wtf is this 3 sep ICD between summon, 1 to 6 and 7 to 11)
- Fischl turbo interaction not implemented
